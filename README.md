# Python for Data Science practce

This repository contains my Python practice and notes for data science.
It focuses on core libraries, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning fundamentals.

## Contents
- pandas: data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and transformation
- numpy: arrays, vectorization, numerical operations
- matplotlib: data visualization and plotting
- sklearn: preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- mini_projects: small end-to-end practice projects

## Purpose
- Strengthen Python fundamentals for data analysis
- Build reusable code snippets for future projects
- Practice machine learning workflows in Python

## Tools & Libraries
Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Scikit-learn

## Notes
Each folder contains short, focused notebooks or scripts demonstrating specific concepts.
